Songwriting
[Vamp on chords for a bit too long]
Writing songs is really hard
I don't know where to start
It's even worse than writing a fucking letter

Writing songs is really hard
I dont know the next part
But at some point I hope it will go better

D Bm  G
Oh shit how do I do a chorus?
D  Bm G 
Oh shit how do I do a chorus?

G
Maybe I'll steal it from Bo Burnham and 
D                    Bm                   
Repeat stuff, Repeat stuff, Repeat stuff
G                    A
Repeat stuff til the punchline lands
   D               Bm
Or do it just like Brendon
       G                A           D
Though I might have to abandon that idea

Because his voice is fucking crazy
And I'm a little bit lazy
Or maybe just maybe it's just fear

I think that went alright
But here is the next plight
I got to find words for another verse

Here is what I'm thinking
I don't have an inkling
what's next 
for better or for worse

I made it to the bridge
Songwriting is a bitch
And I am faced with a tough decision
Do I have the poetic precision
To implement my musical vision

To change up the next refrain
Can I find the words in my brain?
 
O I have an idea
Maybe I'll do it like Tim Minchin
And try myself at inching on the border
Of profanity and glory
Maybe I'll reverse that order
Cause I'm a bit too anxious
To talk about sex or something gorey

Maybe I'll just talk some nonsense,
And hope the crowd will consent,
To listen to more of these idle musings,
Maybe I'll just add a few things.
Thank you  all for all your time
I hope I brought a bit of laughter
I hope your expectations have been met
I'll end this song with one more rhyme
You can tell me after
If you liked what I did with this set
