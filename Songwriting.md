Songwriting
[Vamp on chords for a bit too long]
Writing songs is really hard
I don't know where to start
It's even worse than writing a fucking letter

Writing songs is really hard
I dont know the next part
But at some point I hope it will go better

Oh shit how do I do a chorus?

Maybe I'll steal it from Bo Burnham and 
Repeat stuff, Repeat stuff, Repeat stuff
Repeat stuff til the punchline lands
Or do it just like Brendon
Though I might have to abandon that idea
Because his voice is fucking crazy
And I'm a little bit lazy
Or maybe just maybe it's just fear

I think that went alright
But here is the next plight
I got to find words for another verse

Here is what I'm thinking
I don't have an inkling
what's next 
for better or for worse

I made it to the bridge
Songwriting is a bitch
And I am faced with a tough decision
Do I have the vision
To change up the refrain
Can I find the words in my brain?
 
O I have an idea
Maybe I'll steal it from Tim Minchin
And try myself at inching on the border
Of profanity and glory
Maybe I'll reverse that order
Cause I'm a bit too anxious
To talk about sex or something gorey

I'll have to take the cheap way out
I know just what it's all about
Let's all together have some fun
I'll end this with a terrible pun
I'll have everyone lying at my feet, yes
